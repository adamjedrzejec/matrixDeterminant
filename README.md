# matrixDeterminant
Matrix determinant calculator in C using dynamic memory.

To run the program, you need to run test.sh file.

The 'determinant.c' has to be compiled to to 'det' filename. Compile only if needed.


If you want to make your own matrix to have calculated a matrix determinant, edit one of .txt files in that way:
1. Set first integer value to the order of a matrix
2. Change matrix filling
